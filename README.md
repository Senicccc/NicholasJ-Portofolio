# Nicholas Jeremy - Personal Portfolio Website

This is a fully custom-built personal portfolio website developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS, without any templates or page builders. It features a minimalist black-and-white design, smooth animations using Framer Motion, a dark/light mode toggle, and a fully responsive layout across all devices.

The website includes sections such as landing, skills (with horizontal scroll), projects (with GitHub/demo links), and contact (with social links). Deployed on Vercel, the live site can be accessed here: **[nicholas-jeremy.vercel.app](https://nicholas-jeremy.vercel.app)**
